# categorizer

###### This project is used to assist with categorization of blacklisted domains in the crypto ecosystem.

#### To run:

* `git clone https://github.com/hahnmichaelf/categorizer.git`

* `cd` to the directory in your terminal

* `npm install`

* `node categorize`

##### Using an ~8000-entry json file of blacklisted domains, this was able to categorize 82% of them.

_Note: Since the tokens are run from top to bottom, exiting when a token is detected, this can determine how certain sites are categorized._
